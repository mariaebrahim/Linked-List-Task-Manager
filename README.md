This project manages a to-do list.

This is done through the implementation of a linked list and priorty queue. 

The user has an option to input a task and it will get added to the bottom of the to-do list or they can assign a prioprity to the task and it will be inserted into the queue, and therefore the to-do list, accordingly. Once a task is completed or no lonegr needed it can be removed from the to-do list.

The user can also view all the tasks on their current active to-do list and all completed tasks that have previosuly been crossed off from the to-do list. 

Also includes a testing file.
